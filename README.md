# Evolving Soft Robots Using Genetic Algorithms

## MECS course Assignment 3 led by Professor Hod Lipson

3a Develop a 3D physics simulator

  Demonstrate a bouncing cube and a “breathing” cube
  
3b Evolve a fixed shape robot

  Manually design a robot, evolve a controller to make it move
  
3c Evolve both the shape and behavior of a robot

  Demonstrate a moving robot of various shapes and behavoors
