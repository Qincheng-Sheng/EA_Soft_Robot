# Evolving Soft Robots Using Genetic Algorithms

MECS4510 course Evolutionary Computation & Design Assignment 3 led by Professor Hod Lipson

## Steps of Evolving Soft Robots Using Genetic Algorithms
A. Develop a 3D physics simulator
    
    Demonstrate a bouncing cube and a “breathing” cube
  
B. Evolve a fixed shape robot
    
    Manually design a robot, evolve a controller to make it move
  
C. Evolve both the shape and behavior of a robot
    
    Demonstrate a moving robot of various shapes and behavoors
